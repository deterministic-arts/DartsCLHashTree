Functional Maps and Trees
==========================

This project provides a few purely functional data structures.
Right now, it provides:

  - Hash Trees: purely functional map, based on hashing. The
    implementation is derived from Phil Bagwell's paper "Ideal Hash 
    Trees"

  - Property Tree: a purely functional (sorted) map from 
    strings to arbitrary values. The implementation is derived
    from S. Adams' paper "Implementing Sets Efficiently in a Functional 
    Language"
